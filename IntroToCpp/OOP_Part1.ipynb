    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is considered the core of C++ programming. Its versatility and power in handling data is far better than the procedural programming you learnt before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, OOP is programming where the structures and functions of the data types is defined by the programmers instead. From that, more complex relations can be built between objects such that one object inherits attributes from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast and easy execution\n",
    "* A clear structure\n",
    "* Reduces repeatability when coding\n",
    "* Makes debugging & modifications easier\n",

Each person has varying height, weight, blood type and birth date, but the type of data is similar to one another. It makes sense to group them around the \"person\" instead of parsing it one by one. This is where **structures** come in, a stepping stone before we move to the OOP **class**.\n",
