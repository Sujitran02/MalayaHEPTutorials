    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is considered the core of C++ programming. Its versatility and power in handling data is far better than the procedural programming you learnt before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, OOP is programming where the structures and functions of the data types is defined by the programmers instead. From that, more complex relations can be built between objects such that one object inherits attributes from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast and easy execution\n",
    "* A clear structure\n",
    "* Reduces repeatability when coding\n",

This is where **structures** come in, a stepping stone before we move to the OOP **class**.\n",
