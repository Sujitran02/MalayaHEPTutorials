    "\n",
    "Compared to other programming languages, Python has a few key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpreted:** Everything is processed line by line during runtime, which means it requires no pre-compilation\n",
    "* **Interactive:** An interactive version, iPython, is available if you want to write it interactively\n",
    "* **OOP:** Python, like C++, can support the Object Oriented Programming style, which we will cover in a later tutorial\n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Python just looks, and is, clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing your own lines of code, you need to know that a few words are reserved and cannot be used outside of their presribed usage. We will go through what this means later in Variables. Here are those words:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/keywords.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lines of code can be grouped into blocks, and these blocks are marked by indentation. There are three main rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blocks can contain other blocks\n",
    "* A block starts when the indentation increases\n",
    "* A block ends when an indentation decreases\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Block A\n",
    "Block A\n",
    "    Block A.1\n",

    "        Block A.2\n",
    "Block A\n",

    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Boolean:** ```bool```, the values ```True``` and ```False```\n",
