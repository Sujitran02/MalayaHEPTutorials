    "\n",
    "Compared to other programming languages, Python has a few key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpreted:** Everything is processed line by line during runtime, which means it requires no pre-compilation\n",
    "* **Interactive:** An interactive version, iPython, is available if you want to write it interactively\n",
    "* **OOP:** Python, like C++, can support the Object Oriented Programming style, which we will cover in a later tutorial\n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Python just looks, and is, clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing your own lines of code, you need to know that a few words are reserved and cannot be used outside of their presribed usage. We will go through what this means later in Variables. Here are those words:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/keywords.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lines of code can be grouped into blocks, and these blocks are marked by indentation. There are three main rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blocks can contain other blocks\n",
    "* A block starts when the indentation increases\n",
    "* A block ends when an indentation decreases\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Block A\n",
    "Block A\n",
    "    Block A.1\n",

    "        Block A.2\n",
    "Block A\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other programming languages, Python can comment out lines of code using ```#```. When a line is commented, the Python interpreter ignores it, which means it will not run. To comment multiple lines, enclose them with ` \"\"\" `.\n",

    "\n",
    "Among the built-in data types in Python are:\n",
    "* **Text:** ```string```, they are enclosed by ```\"``` or ```'```.\n",
    "* **Numeric:** ```int```, ```float```, ```complex```, basically any numbers\n",
    "* **Boolean:** ```bool```, the values ```True``` and ```False```\n",
    "\n",
    "While naming the variables, there are specific rules:\n",
    "* The name starts with a letter or ```_```, not with a number\n",
    "* Besides the first character, the name can contain other alpha-numeric characters\n",
    "* The names are case-sensitive and unique, they cannot share with one another\n",
    "\n",
