    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Being one of the more modern programming languages, Python supports the object oriented paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, OOP is programming such that the structures and functions of the data types is defined by the programmers instead. From that, more complex relations can be built between objects such that one object inherits attributes from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast and easy execution\n",
    "* A clear structure\n",
    "* Reduces repeatability when coding\n",
    "* Makes debugging & modifications easier\n",

    "## Class\n",
